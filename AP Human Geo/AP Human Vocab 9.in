Rostow, W. W.
in 1960 proposed a widely cited model for economic advancement. Generalizing on the "sweep of modern history," he theorized that all developing economies may pass through five successive stages of growth and advancement.
"Stages of Growth" model
model where economic development is based on the idea of successive stages of development. Each stage is seen as leading the next, though some regions or countries may take longer than others to make the transition from one state to the next. According to this view, now regarded as overall simplistic, places and regions can be seen as following parallel courses within a world that is steadily modernizing. Late starters will eventually make progress, but at speeds determined by their resource endowments, their productivity, and the wisdom of their people's policies and decisions. The five stages are: 1. Traditional society, 2. Preconditions for Take-Off (commercial exploitation of agriculture and extractive industry), 3. Take-Off (development of a manufacturing sector), 4. Drive to Maturity (development of wider industrial and commercial base), 5. High Mass Consumption.
